# Data-Engineering-Projects
This repository includes different data engineering projects that I worked on!!

1. ETL Data Pipelines using Apache Airflow DAG
    * A simple ETL Data Pipeline that extracts data from different file formats, transforms and loads into a staging area!
    * Files - ETL_toll_data.py, tolldata.tgz, Airflow_DAGS_view.png, Graphical_view.png
2. Streaming Data Pipeline using Apache Kafka
     * A data pipeline that collects the streaming data and loads into a database.
     * Files - toll_traffic_generator.py, streaming_data_reader.py, Database_results.png, Data_Generator_Output.png, Data_Consumer_Output.png
3. Acquiring and Processing Information on the World's Largest Banks - ETL Application
     * A complete end-to-end ETL project that collects data from a website via webscraping and performs extract, transform, and loading to a database operations.
     * Files - banks_project.py, codelog.txt, banks.db, exchange_rate.csv, Largest_banks.csv
4. Designing, implementing, and querying a data warehouse using PostgreSQL.
     * A complete data warehouse design for a solid waste management company that operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and trassport solid waste and collects waste across different cities in Brazil.
     * As a data engineer, the following reports/insights were retreived from the above-designed data warehouse.
     * total waste collected per year per city
     * total waste collected per month per city
     * total waste collected per quarter per city
     * total waste collected per year per trucktype
     * total waste collected per trucktype per city
     * total waste collected per trucktype per station per city
     * Files - DimDate.csv, DimStation.csv, DimTruck.csv, FactTrips, TruckStarSchema
