🛠️ Data Engineering Projects
Welcome!
This repository highlights a collection of real-world Data Engineering projects I have designed and implemented, focusing on ETL pipelines, streaming architectures, data warehousing, and workflow orchestration.

📚 Project Portfolio

| Project | Description | Tech Stack | Key Files |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| ![Airflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Airflow-ETL%20Pipeline-blue) <br> **ETL Data Pipelines** | Designed a scalable ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load data from multiple file formats into a staging area. | Apache Airflow, Python | `ETL_toll_data.py`, `tolldata.tgz`, `Airflow_DAGS_view.png`, `Graphical_view.png` |
| ![Kafka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Kafka-Streaming%20Pipeline-orange) <br> **Streaming Data Pipeline** | Built a real-time streaming data pipeline to collect and load traffic data into a database for analytics. | Apache Kafka, Python | `toll_traffic_generator.py`, `streaming_data_reader.py`, `Database_results.png`, `Data_Generator_Output.png`, `Data_Consumer_Output.png` |
| ![ETL](https://img.shields.io/badge/Web%20Scraping-ETL%20Application-lightgrey) <br> **Largest Banks ETL** | Developed a full ETL pipeline to scrape, transform, and store financial data from the web into a database. | Python, SQLite | `banks_project.py`, `codelog.txt`, `banks.db`, `exchange_rate.csv`, `Largest_banks.csv` |
| ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-Data%20Warehouse-blueviolet) <br> **Solid Waste Management Data Warehouse** | Designed and queried a data warehouse for waste collection insights across Brazilian cities. | PostgreSQL, Data Modeling, SQL Analytics | `DimDate.csv`, `DimStation.csv`, `DimTruck.csv`, `FactTrips`, `TruckStarSchema` |
